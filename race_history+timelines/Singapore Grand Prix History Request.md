# **A Deep Dive into the Singapore Grand Prix: Track Records and Untold Stories**

The Singapore Grand Prix, held at the Marina Bay Street Circuit, is a truly unique event in the world of Formula 1\. First held in 2008 as the inaugural night race in F1 history, this challenging street circuit has produced some unforgettable moments over the years1. Sadly, the race wasn't held in 2020 or 2021 due to the pandemic, but it returned in 2022 with renewed vigor1. This article delves into the history of the Singapore Grand Prix, exploring track records, driver performances, and the quirky incidents that have made this race a fan favorite.

## **Track Records and Evolution**

The Marina Bay Street Circuit has undergone several changes throughout its history. A purpose-built section of track includes the start/finish area, pits, and paddock, while the latter stages of the lap see the cars pass beneath one of the spectator grandstands2. Minor revisions were made to the circuit in 2009, and in 2018, Turns 16 and 17 were realigned2. The most recent update in 2023 significantly altered the track layout due to redevelopment works in the vicinity3. This involved removing the section between Turns 16 and 19 of the 2022 layout and creating one long 397.9m straight, reducing the total number of corners from 23 to 193. These changes were expected to reduce the circuit length from 5.063km to 4.928km and increase the number of laps in the Grand Prix from 61 to 633. The total race distance is 306.143km4. These alterations have led to some variations in lap records and fastest times. Here's a breakdown of the key records:

**Current Track Records (2023 \- present):**

* **Pole Position:** Lando Norris (McLaren) \- 1:29.525 (2024) 5  
* **Race Winner:** Lando Norris (McLaren) \- 1:40:52.571 (62 laps) (2024) 5  
* **Fastest Lap:** Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull) \- 1:34.486 (2024) 5  
* **All-Time Lap Record:** Lando Norris (McLaren) \- 1:29.525 (2024) 5

**Previous Track Records (up to 2022):**

* **Fastest Lap:** Kevin Magnussen (Haas) \- 1:41.905 (2018) 6

It's worth noting that the 2023 changes to the circuit have made the track significantly faster7. This is reflected in the difference between the current and previous lap records. The changes might also present drivers with a new overtaking opportunity into the new Turn 16 (previously Turn 20\)8.

## **Dominance and Victories**

Over the years, several teams and drivers have etched their names into the Singapore Grand Prix's history. Here's a closer look at the most successful contenders:

### **Teams**

| Team | Wins | Consecutive Wins | First 1-2 Finish |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Mercedes | 4 | 3 (2016-2018) | \- |
| Red Bull | 4 | 3 (2011-2013) | \- |
| Ferrari | 4 | \- | 2019 |

Mercedes engines have powered five victories at the Marina Bay Street Circuit1. In 2019, Ferrari became the first team to record a 1-2 finish at the Singapore Grand Prix, with Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc leading the pack9. Notably, Ferrari was the only team other than Red Bull to win a race in the 2023 season, with Carlos Sainz's victory in Singapore9.

### **Drivers**

| Driver | Wins | Fastest Laps | Laps Led |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Sebastian Vettel | 5 | \- | 252 |
| Lewis Hamilton | 4 | 3 | \- |
| Fernando Alonso | 2 | 2 | \- |
| Daniel Ricciardo | \- | 3 | \- |
| Kevin Magnussen | \- | 2 | \- |

Sebastian Vettel leads with five victories (2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2019\)4. Lewis Hamilton has triumphed on four occasions at the Marina Bay Circuit4. Fernando Alonso is another repeat winner in Singapore4. Other notable winners include Nico Rosberg10. Initially, Fernando Alonso, Daniel Ricciardo, Lewis Hamilton, and Kevin Magnussen were tied with two fastest laps each. However, Hamilton secured his third fastest lap in 2023, and Ricciardo equaled this record in 20241. Sebastian Vettel holds the record for the most laps led in Singapore, with 252 laps, just slightly ahead of Lewis Hamilton1. Interestingly, ten of the fifteen races held at Marina Bay have been won from pole position1. Sergio Perez became the first driver to win the Singapore Grand Prix from second on the grid in 20221.

## **A Challenging Race**

The Singapore Grand Prix is renowned for its demanding nature, pushing both cars and drivers to their limits. The high temperatures and humidity, coupled with the bumpy street circuit, make it one of the toughest races on the calendar10. Drivers can lose up to 3kg of body weight during the race due to fluid loss from sweating11. The unique characteristics of the Marina Bay Street Circuit, including its 23 corners, tight turns, unforgiving walls, and night racing conditions, add to the challenge13. The high-speed nature of the lap means drivers are constantly working the wheel, further increasing the physical strain13. Adding to the complexity, drivers remain on European time in Singapore, disrupting their usual routines and adding another layer of difficulty to an already demanding race11. As Charles Leclerc shared in an interview, "The Singapore Grand Prix is one of the most challenging races on the calendar due to the high heat and humidity, as well as its long duration." 14

## **Anecdotes and Unusual Incidents**

The Singapore Grand Prix has seen its fair share of peculiar incidents over the years, adding to the race's unique character and charm. Here are a few that stand out:

* **The Hitchhiker:** In 2013, after Mark Webber's car broke down on the last lap, Fernando Alonso, who finished second, stopped to give Webber a lift back to the pits on his Ferrari. This act of sportsmanship, while heartwarming, resulted in reprimands for both drivers and a grid penalty for Webber in the next race15. It highlights the camaraderie that can exist between drivers even in the heat of competition.  
* **The Track Invader:** In 2015, a spectator inexplicably ran across the track during the race, causing a safety car deployment and endangering himself and the drivers15. This incident led to increased security measures and served as a reminder of the importance of spectator safety.  
* **The Singapore Sling Chicane:** Until 2013, the circuit featured the "Singapore Sling" chicane at Turn 10, a tight and awkward corner that often led to incidents and driver frustration2. Its removal streamlined the track and likely reduced the number of collisions.  
* **Thirsty Vettel:** In 2022, Sebastian Vettel's drinks bottle malfunctioned during the race, leaving him dehydrated after his victory11. This incident highlights the extreme physical demands of the Singapore Grand Prix and the importance of proper hydration for the drivers.  
* **Flaming Pit Stop:** In 2022, Pierre Gasly's AlphaTauri caught fire during a pit stop, creating a dramatic scene16. Thankfully, Gasly was unharmed, but the incident served as a reminder of the inherent dangers of motorsport.  
* **Larry the Lizard:** In 2024, a lizard caused a red flag during a practice session by wandering onto the track17. This wasn't the first lizard encounter at the Singapore Grand Prix; in 2023, Fernando Alonso reported a lizard on the track during practice, with commentators jokingly describing it as doing the "floss" dance17. These incidents add a touch of the unexpected to the Singapore Grand Prix and remind us that the race takes place in a tropical environment where wildlife encounters are always a possibility.
