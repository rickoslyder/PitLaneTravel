This article delves into the track's rich past, exploring its notable records and uncovering some of the most entertaining anecdotes associated with the drivers and the circuit itself.

## **Track Records**

The Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez has undergone several transformations throughout its history, resulting in various track layouts with their own unique records1. The current Grand Prix circuit, with a length of 4.304 km, boasts a challenging combination of high-speed straights, tight corners, and the iconic Peraltada final corner2.

To better illustrate the track records, here's a table summarizing the key achievements:

* **Wins from Pole Position:** Out of the 24 Mexican Grands Prix held, 11 have been won from pole position. Interestingly, only two of the last seven races have been won from pole, with the 2022 Mexico City Grand Prix being the first to be won from the front of the grid since 20162.

These records showcase the diverse range of racing experiences the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez has offered throughout its history.

## **The High-Altitude Challenge**

The Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez sits over 7,200 feet above sea level, making it one of the highest circuits in Formula 13. This high altitude presents unique challenges for both drivers and teams, significantly impacting car performance and requiring specific adaptations.

The thinner air at this altitude reduces air pressure by approximately 20%, which affects engine performance and aerodynamics4. Teams must carefully adjust their car setups, often opting for higher downforce configurations to compensate for the reduced grip5. Drivers also need to adapt their driving style, as the reduced drag can lead to higher top speeds but also less downforce in corners.

Kevin Magnussen described the challenge, stating that "You lack grip and the car feels very slippery, especially at the start of the weekend." 5 This unique environment demands precision and adaptability from those who dare to race at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez.

## **Fun Anecdotes**

Beyond the track records and technical challenges, the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez is brimming with captivating stories and anecdotes.

* **The Stadium Section:** One of the most distinctive features of the circuit is the stadium section, where the track winds through the Foro Sol baseball stadium3. This unique design creates an electric atmosphere, with tens of thousands of fans cheering on the drivers as they navigate the tight corners. Romain Grosjean described the experience as "special," noting that "The driver parade, going through the stadium, is special." 5 The stadium section has become a fan favorite and a symbol of the Mexican Grand Prix's vibrant energy5.  
* **Overcoming Adversity:** In the 2023 Mexico City Grand Prix, Pascal Wehrlein, driving for Porsche in the Formula E race, faced a significant setback when he was involved in a heavy crash during the first round6. Despite the incident, Wehrlein showed remarkable resilience, recovering from his injuries and returning to the track with determination. He expressed his gratitude for the halo safety device, which undoubtedly played a crucial role in protecting him during the crash6.  
* **Hamilton's Historic Win:** In 2019, Lewis Hamilton achieved a remarkable feat by becoming the first driver to win the Mexican Grand Prix from third on the grid since Jacky Ickx in 19707. This victory not only showcased Hamilton's exceptional driving skills but also highlighted the unpredictable nature of racing at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez.

These anecdotes capture the spirit of the circuit, showcasing the resilience of the drivers and the unique atmosphere that surrounds the Mexican Grand Prix.
