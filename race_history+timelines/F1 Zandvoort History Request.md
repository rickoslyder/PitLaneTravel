## **A Circuit Steeped in History**

The story of Circuit Zandvoort begins in 1939 with a temporary street circuit race organized by local enthusiasts. The event's success paved the way for a permanent facility nestled among the Zandvoort dunes. Designed by 1927 Le Mans winner S.C.H. "Sammy" Davis, the circuit incorporated existing roads built by the German army during the occupation5. The current layout has an elevation difference of 8.9m (29ft) and features two steep banked corners, Hugenholtzbocht at an 18-degree angle and Arie Luyendijkbocht at 19-degrees, designed to create exciting overtaking opportunities5.

The first official race, the "Prijs van Zandvoort," took place on August 7, 19483. The circuit quickly gained popularity among drivers and teams, becoming a regular venue for testing and racing. Zandvoort hosted its first Formula One Dutch Grand Prix in 1952, solidifying its place on the international motorsports stage. This race, however, was run under Formula Two regulations, as were all European rounds that year. The 1953 race followed the same format2.

The Dutch Grand Prix was not held in 1954, 1956, or 1957\. The first true Formula One race as part of the Drivers' Championship took place in 19552. Over the years, Zandvoort has undergone various modifications and renovations. Between 1989 and 1998, the circuit was shortened to a 2.526 km Club Circuit to accommodate development in the area2. During this time, the southern part of the track was used to build a Bungalow Park and new premises for local sports clubs2.

In 1995, Circuit Park Zandvoort (CPZ) received the "A Status" from the Dutch government, allowing it to host international Grand Prix races2. This led to the construction of a new international Grand Prix Circuit, with the main grandstand opening in 19993. The circuit's most recent renovation came in preparation for the return of the Dutch Grand Prix in 2020\. This included significant track modifications to meet modern Formula 1 safety standards 7 and the addition of the two banked corners mentioned earlier.

Today, Circuit Zandvoort is a vibrant hub for motorsports, hosting a variety of events beyond Formula One, including the GT World Challenge Europe, DTM (Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters), and ADAC GT Masters2. The circuit boasts a capacity of 105,000 spectators and is currently owned by Prince Bernhard of Orange-Nassau Menno de Jong2. It holds an FIA Grade 1 license, signifying its ability to host the highest level of motorsports events2.

Interestingly, the pit lane at Zandvoort is not just about the cars. Above the pit lane, there are 16 VIP lounges, Bernie's Bar & Kitchen, and the Media Center. The pit lane itself is 150 meters long with a speed limit of 60 kilometers per hour3. Adding to the circuit's diverse history, several DJs, including Armin van Buuren, Don Diablo, and Brennan Heart, have filmed music videos at Zandvoort, showcasing its versatility as a venue3.

A fun fact for fans: Jos Verstappen celebrated his birthday on the same day that his son, Max, reopened the renovated Circuit Zandvoort on March 4, 20203. This marked a symbolic passing of the torch and a new era for Dutch motorsports.

The return of the Dutch Grand Prix in 2020, after a 35-year absence, has significantly boosted the circuit's international profile and contributed to the resurgence of Dutch motorsport6. The renovations and the exciting racing action have re-established Zandvoort as a premier destination for Formula 1 fans and drivers alike.

## **Driver Anecdotes**

Zandvoort's unique characteristics and challenging layout have left a lasting impression on many drivers. Lewis Hamilton described the track as "epic," stating, “Ah man, the track is epic\! It's really fantastic… It brought back so many memories when I first got out there… because I didn't really remember. I knew it was great when I was in Formula 3, but it's crazy in a Formula 1 car." 8 He further praised it as "a real racing circuit," highlighting the high-speed corners and overall flow, particularly the speed through Turn 78.

Esteban Ocon shared this enthusiasm, saying, "It was honestly a pure pleasure to drive on this track. It's good fun, the banking but also just the layout in general. When I drove in 2016, I had great memories from it, and in Formula 1, it's even better. It's pure fun\!" 8 He particularly enjoyed the banked corners, which add a unique challenge and thrill to the driving experience.

Valtteri Bottas, a two-time winner of the Masters of Formula 3 competition at Zandvoort, expressed his excitement about tackling the circuit in a Formula 1 car, stating, “I hope it's good fun to watch, as it's definitely good fun in the car. Tomorrow will be fun in the qualifying and even today, I really enjoyed it, those banked corners." 8
