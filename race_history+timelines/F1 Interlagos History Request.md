Over the years, several records have been set at this historic circuit. Here are some key track records and statistics:

* **Fewest Finishers (1977):** The 1977 Brazilian Grand Prix was a race of attrition, with only 7 out of 22 starters reaching the chequered flag. This race highlighted the challenging nature of Interlagos, especially in an era when car reliability was less consistent8.

This achievement set a new Formula 1 record for the highest percentage of wins in a single season. "It was an amazing weekend," Verstappen said. "The car was incredible, and I felt really comfortable on the track." 2  
* **Sunday Qualifying and Race (2024):** In an unusual turn of events, both qualifying and the Grand Prix took place on Sunday at the 2024 Brazilian Grand Prix due to adverse weather conditions. This change in schedule added an extra layer of challenge for the teams and drivers, as they had to adapt to the compressed timetable5.

## **The Cultural Significance of the Brazilian Grand Prix**

The Brazilian Grand Prix is more than just a race; it's a celebration of motorsport and Brazilian culture. The passionate fans create an electric atmosphere 2, and the event is deeply ingrained in the country's sporting identity 9. Brazil has a rich history in Formula 1, with legendary drivers like Emerson Fittipaldi, Nelson Piquet, and Ayrton Senna inspiring generations of fans. Brazilian drivers have also historically performed well at Interlagos, having taken more pole positions than drivers from any other nation 5.

The Brazilian Grand Prix often serves as the season finale, adding an extra layer of excitement and tension to the event 2. The unpredictable weather conditions in Brazil also add an element of unpredictability to the races, making them even more thrilling to watch 2. The combination of passionate fans, a challenging circuit, and the potential for dramatic weather makes the Brazilian Grand Prix a truly unique and captivating event.

Ayrton Senna, in particular, had a profound impact on the popularity of Formula 1 in Brazil. His charisma, talent, and tragic death in 1994 cemented his status as a national hero. The Senna "S" complex at Interlagos is a testament to his legacy, and his presence is still felt at the Brazilian Grand Prix.

## **The Evolution of Interlagos**

Interlagos has undergone several transformations throughout its history. Originally opened in 1940 as a dirt track named "Autódromo de Interlagos" 10, it was later paved with asphalt. The circuit was initially a much longer and faster layout, with a first corner that was considered one of the most challenging in Grand Prix racing 11. However, safety concerns and the desire to create more overtaking opportunities led to modifications in the 1990s and early 2000s10.

Interestingly, the land where Interlagos is located was originally purchased in 1926 by property developers with plans to build residential accommodations 12. However, due to financial difficulties, including the 1929 stock market crash, those plans were abandoned, and the decision was made to construct a racing circuit instead. The original design of Interlagos was based on New York's Roosevelt Field Raceway 12.

In 1957, a link road was added to the circuit, connecting Turn 4 and Junção corners to form an outer speed ring, essentially creating an oddly-shaped oval course 13. This modification added another dimension to the circuit's layout.

The rise of Brazilian drivers like Emerson Fittipaldi and Ayrton Senna played a significant role in the evolution of Interlagos. Fittipaldi's success in the early 1970s spurred the development of Interlagos, while Senna's popularity in the late 1980s and early 1990s led to further investment and modifications to the circuit 7.

The circuit was renamed in 1985 to honor Carlos Pace, a Brazilian driver who tragically died in a plane crash in 1977 12. Pace had won the 1975 Brazilian Grand Prix at Interlagos, making it a fitting tribute to his legacy. He was returning to Brazil during a break in the Formula 1 season, just 13 days after the death of fellow driver Tom Pryce, which had deeply affected him 15.

The Brazilian Grand Prix was held at another track, the Jacarepaguá circuit in Rio de Janeiro, between 1978 and 1989 16. This move coincided with the rise of Nelson Piquet, a driver from Rio de Janeiro 7. However, Interlagos was reinstated as the home of the Brazilian Grand Prix in 1990 and has remained so ever since.

Today, Interlagos also boasts a kart circuit named after Ayrton Senna, further solidifying the connection between the circuit and Brazilian motorsport legends 17.
