## **A Look Back at Each Race**

Each Saudi Arabian Grand Prix at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit has been filled with excitement and drama. Let's take a closer look at some of the key moments from each race:

**2021: A Controversial Debut**

The inaugural race at Jeddah in 2021 was marked by a fierce battle between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen for the world championship. The race was interrupted by two red flags and several safety car periods, adding to the tension and strategic complexities3. One of the most controversial moments occurred when Hamilton crashed into the back of Verstappen's car. Verstappen had slowed down to let Hamilton pass, following instructions from the stewards due to an earlier incident where he was deemed to have gained an advantage off track4. However, the sudden deceleration caught Hamilton off guard, leading to the collision. This incident, along with several other controversial decisions by the FIA, fueled debates about the fairness of the championship battle and the consistency of stewarding5. Ultimately, Hamilton emerged victorious, but the race left a lasting impression due to its dramatic and contentious nature.

**2022: Safety Concerns and Thrilling Battles**

The 2022 race was overshadowed by safety concerns following a missile attack on an Aramco oil depot near the circuit7. Drivers expressed their worries, with Sergio Perez calling the track "the most dangerous place on the calendar." 4 Max Verstappen also voiced his concerns, stating that some of the high-speed corners should be redesigned for safety4. Despite the concerns, the race delivered thrilling battles, particularly between Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc, who engaged in a strategic duel using DRS to their advantage8. A curious incident occurred when Fernando Alonso, Daniel Ricciardo, and Valtteri Bottas all retired from the race around the same time on lap 388. Verstappen ultimately claimed victory9. In Formula 2, the race was won by Felipe Drugovich4.

**2023: Perez's Second Triumph and Verstappen's Recovery**

The 2023 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix saw Sergio Perez secure his second victory of the season, having also won in Bahrain10. He converted his pole position into a race win, but not without challenges. Fernando Alonso initially took the lead at the start, but Perez fought back to reclaim the position11. Max Verstappen, starting from 15th on the grid due to a driveshaft issue in qualifying, showcased his remarkable racecraft by finishing second12. Fernando Alonso initially finished third but was given a 10-second penalty after the race, only to have it overturned later, reinstating his podium position12. Frederik Vesti took the victory in the Formula 2 race4.

**2024: Verstappen Dominates, Bearman Debuts**

Max Verstappen dominated the 2024 race, securing a comfortable victory from pole position13. The race also saw the debut of Ollie Bearman, replacing Carlos Sainz who was recovering from appendicitis14. Bearman impressed by finishing in the points and holding off seasoned drivers like Lando Norris and Lewis Hamilton13. He became the third youngest driver to start an F1 race and the first to debut with Ferrari since Arturo Merzario at the 1972 British Grand Prix15. Nico Hulkenberg secured a point for Haas, their first of the season16.

## **Unique Characteristics and Challenges**

The Jeddah Corniche Circuit stands out as one of the fastest and most demanding tracks on the Formula 1 calendar. Here are some of its unique characteristics and challenges:

* **High-Speed Street Circuit:** With an average speed exceeding 250 km/h, it's the fastest street circuit in Formula 117. The circuit's design, with its long straights and high-speed corners, pushes the cars and drivers to their limits.  
* **Blind Corners and High Walls:** The track features numerous blind corners and high walls, demanding precision and bravery from the drivers17. This combination of speed and limited visibility creates a unique challenge, where drivers need to be confident in their car and their own abilities to navigate the circuit safely.  
* **Limited Run-Off Areas:** The tight confines of the circuit offer limited run-off areas, increasing the risk of incidents and safety car deployments19. This characteristic adds to the tension of the race, as even small mistakes can have significant consequences.  
* **Traffic Management:** With 27 corners, navigating traffic during qualifying and race starts can be a significant challenge20. The high-speed nature of the circuit makes it even more difficult for drivers to find clear track and maximize their lap times.  
* **Longest Street Circuit:** The Jeddah Corniche Circuit is the longest of all the Formula 1 street circuits21.  
* **Three DRS Zones:** To encourage overtaking, the circuit features three DRS zones21.  
* **Turn 13 Banking:** The hairpin at Turn 13 features twelve degrees of banking15.

## **Construction and Evolution**

The Jeddah Corniche Circuit was constructed in record time, taking just eight months to complete22. Fifty local and international contracting companies participated in its construction22. The project required 37,000 tons of asphalt, 600,000 tons of cement, 30,000 square meters of bricks, and 1,400 tons of glass18. The circuit was designed by Carsten Tilke, son of renowned circuit designer Hermann Tilke23. Built along the Red Sea coastline, the track incorporates existing roads and features a mix of permanent and temporary structures23. It is the first street circuit in the Gulf region to feature LED floodlights and slot drains for large drainage capacity24. The construction was completed in compliance with stringent Saudi Arabian labor regulations, with ATLAS safety training being mandatory for all workers24.

The initial plan for a Saudi Arabian Grand Prix was focused on a purpose-built facility in Qiddiya, with former Formula One driver Alexander Wurz involved in the project17. However, the focus shifted to Jeddah, and the Corniche Circuit was born. Since its construction, the circuit has undergone minor modifications to improve safety, including widening some corners and re-profiling certain sections25. The circuit also includes a short circuit configuration1.

## **Driver Perspectives**

Drivers have expressed a mix of excitement and apprehension about the Jeddah Corniche Circuit. Here are some of their comments:

* **Sergio Perez:** "It's definitely the most dangerous place on the calendar." 4 Perez's comment reflects the concerns raised by several drivers about the safety of the circuit, particularly after the 2022 missile attack and Mick Schumacher's heavy crash during qualifying that year.  
* **Max Verstappen:** "Some flat-out curves need to be removed... just design it straight... it's safer for everyone." 4 Verstappen's suggestion highlights the challenge posed by the circuit's high-speed corners and limited run-off areas.  
* **Daniel Ricciardo:** "It's a really nice, fast and fluid circuit out there, a really enjoyable one." 20 Ricciardo's comment captures the exhilarating experience of driving the Jeddah Corniche Circuit, with its flowing layout and high-speed sections.  
* **Carlos Sainz:** "It's fun, it's a good track. It's really high speed, but has lots of kind of good flow to it." 20 Sainz echoes Ricciardo's sentiment, emphasizing the enjoyment factor of driving this unique track.  
* **Zane Maloney:** "I did have a good battle with Kush. We were so on the limit in Turn 1 I had to cut Turn 2\. In the past I would have waited for the team to tell me to give the place back, but then you lose a second or two, so I just gave it back to him straightaway and thought I can get him again." 26 Maloney's comments highlight the close racing and overtaking opportunities the circuit provides, even with its tight layout. He also mentions the importance of managing tires and making quick decisions during the race.

## **Conclusion: A Thrilling Addition to the F1 Calendar**

The Jeddah Corniche Circuit has quickly established itself as a unique and exciting venue in Formula 1\. Its high-speed layout, challenging corners, and stunning seaside location create a spectacle for both drivers and fans. While safety concerns remain a valid point of discussion, the circuit has undergone improvements, and its thrilling races have contributed to some of the most memorable moments in recent F1 history. The contrast between the drivers' concerns about safety and the exciting, close racing the circuit produces highlights the inherent tension and risk associated with Formula 1\.

The Jeddah Corniche Circuit also plays a significant role in the broader context of F1's expansion into new regions. Its presence in Saudi Arabia reflects the sport's growing global reach and its willingness to engage with new audiences. However, this expansion has also drawn criticism due to concerns about human rights and the political situation in the region. The FIA and Formula 1 face the challenge of balancing their commercial interests with their responsibility to promote ethical and sustainable practices.

As the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix continues to evolve, it promises to deliver more excitement and drama in the years to come. The circuit's future will likely depend on its ability to address safety concerns, maintain its thrilling racing characteristics, and navigate the complexities of its relationship with the Saudi Arabian government.
