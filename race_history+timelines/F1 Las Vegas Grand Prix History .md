# **The Las Vegas Grand Prix: Fast Cars, Bright Lights, and Unforgettable Moments**

The Las Vegas Grand Prix, held on the iconic Las Vegas Strip Circuit, is a spectacle unlike any other in Formula 1\. With its high speeds, glamorous setting, and thrilling racing action, it has quickly become a fan favorite. But beyond the glitz and glamour, the Las Vegas Grand Prix has a rich history, both recent and dating back to the early days of Formula 1\. Let's dive into the track records, memorable moments, and fascinating anecdotes that make this race so special.

## **A Blast from the Past: Formula 1's Early Days in Vegas**

While the current Las Vegas Grand Prix debuted in 2023, Formula 1's history in Sin City goes back to the early 1980s. In 1981 and 1982, the Caesars Palace Grand Prix was held on a temporary circuit constructed in the hotel's parking lot1. This early foray into Las Vegas was not without its challenges. The track, known for its tight and twisty layout, was not popular among drivers, with some even describing it as "one of the worst circuits Formula 1 has ever visited." 3

Despite its unpopularity, the Caesars Palace Grand Prix saw some legendary drivers like Alan Jones and Nelson Piquet compete for victory2. Interestingly, both years the championship was decided in Las Vegas, with Nelson Piquet and Keke Rosberg clinching the title in '81 and '82 respectively4. Before Formula 1's return, the last major open-wheel race on the streets of Las Vegas was the 2007 Vegas Grand Prix, part of the Champ Car World Series5. This race saw Will Power take his first victory in the series.

## **The Las Vegas Strip Circuit: Where Speed Meets Spectacle**

Building upon this history, the modern Las Vegas Strip Circuit is a purpose-built street circuit designed to showcase the city's vibrant atmosphere1. The circuit was designed by Tilke GmbH, with Carsten Tilke, son of renowned circuit designer Hermann Tilke, leading the project6. At 3.853 miles long with 17 corners, it winds its way through some of the most iconic landmarks on the Las Vegas Strip6. Imagine Formula 1 cars speeding past the Bellagio fountains, Caesars Palace, and the MSG Sphere – it's a truly unique experience3.

The city has granted Formula One permission to use the roads required for the race for ten years7. When the race was announced in March 2022, the track layout featured 14 corners. It was later revised with the addition of a chicane, bringing the number of corners to 177. Formula One also made a significant investment in the city, purchasing a piece of land for $240 million to build permanent pit and paddock facilities6. These facilities are not only used during race weekends but also contribute to the overall infrastructure of the area.

The circuit itself is a high-speed spectacle, designed to deliver thrilling racing action. It features long straights where cars can reach top speeds, interspersed with challenging corners that test the drivers' skills and bravery6. One of the most notable features is a 1.2-mile straight along Las Vegas Boulevard, where cars can reach exhilarating speeds6. This combination of speed, challenging corners, and the iconic backdrop of the Las Vegas Strip is what sets this Grand Prix apart6.

## **Track Records: A Glimpse of the Fastest Laps**

While the Las Vegas Grand Prix is still relatively new, some impressive track records have already been set. Here's a look at the fastest laps from the 2023 and 2024 races:

In the 2024 race, George Russell secured pole position with a time of 1:32.312, demonstrating the grip and downforce levels achievable on this track6. These records are sure to be challenged in future races as drivers become more familiar with the circuit and car technology continues to evolve.

## **Memorable Moments: From Double Overtakes to Dramatic Victories**

The Las Vegas Grand Prix has already produced its fair share of unforgettable moments. In the inaugural 2023 race, Sergio Perez pulled off a daring double overtake, passing both Liam Lawson and Kevin Magnussen in one go9. This audacious move showcased Perez's skill and racecraft, highlighting the overtaking opportunities the circuit provides.

The 2024 race saw George Russell dominate from start to finish, securing a memorable victory for Mercedes9. Despite facing pressure from his teammate Lewis Hamilton, Russell held his nerve to take the checkered flag9.

Beyond the on-track action, the Las Vegas Grand Prix is known for its off-track spectacle. The 2023 race weekend featured a star-studded grid walk with celebrities like Will.i.am and Gordon Ramsay adding to the glamorous atmosphere11. This blend of sporting drama and entertainment is what makes the Las Vegas Grand Prix such a unique event11.

## **Driver's Perspectives**

Drivers have expressed a mix of excitement and apprehension about the Las Vegas Strip Circuit. Fernando Alonso, a two-time F1 champion, finished ninth in the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix12.

As drivers gain more experience on the circuit, their insights and perspectives will continue to add to the narrative of the Las Vegas Grand Prix.

## **Anecdotes and Insights: Adding Color to the Story**

Every Formula 1 race has its own unique stories and anecdotes, and the Las Vegas Grand Prix is no exception.
